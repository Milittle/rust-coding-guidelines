# 2.3 Annotations and Documentation

In Rust, there are two types of annotations: normal annotations and documentation annotations. Normal comments use `//` or `/* ... */`, and document comments use `///`, `//! ` or `/** ... **/`.

When referring to "comments" in the principles and rules, this includes both normal comments and document comments. When "documentation" is mentioned, it refers specifically to documentation comments.
