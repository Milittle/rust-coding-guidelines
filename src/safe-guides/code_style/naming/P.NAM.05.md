## P.NAM.05 The `getter` family of methods used to access or retrieve data should not normally have the prefix `get_`

**[Description]**

Because of Rust's ownership semantics, both methods' parameters in following cases use shared reference `&self` or exclusive reference `&mut self` , which represent `getter` semantics.

> `getter` semantics always mean to return an object but a reference in Rust's ownership conventions.

There are also some exceptions to use `get_` prefix.


**[Bad Case]**
```rust
pub struct First;
pub struct Second;

pub struct S {
    first: First,
    second: Second,
}

impl S {
    // Bad: Shouldn't use 'get_' prefix to name accesssing member function.
    pub fn get_first(&self) -> &First {
        &self.first
    }

    // Badï¼š
    // `get_mut_first`, or `mut_first` are also not good.
    pub fn get_first_mut(&mut self) -> &mut First {
        &mut self.first
    }

    // set_ prefix is fine.
    pub fn set_first(&mut self, f: First) -> &mut First {
        self.first = f;
    }
}
```


**[Good Case]**

```rust
pub struct First;
pub struct Second;

pub struct S {
    first: First,
    second: Second,
}

impl S {
    // Ok
    pub fn first(&self) -> &First {
        &self.first
    }

    // Ok
    pub fn first_mut(&mut self) -> &mut First {
        &mut self.first
    }

    // set_ prefix is fine.
    pub fn set_first(&mut self, f: First) -> &mut First {
        self.first = f;
    }
}
```

**[Exception]**

However, there are also some exceptions: Only in cases to retrieve data by `getter` explicitly, could name with `get_` prefix. For example, `Cell::get` could access the data in one `Cell`.

For `getter` checked in runtime, such as bounds checking, we could consider to add an Unsafe `_unchecked` methods. Generally, there would be following function signatures.

```rust
// Do some checks in runtime, such as bounds checking.
fn get(&self, index: K) -> Option<&V>;
fn get_mut(&mut self, index: K) -> Option<&mut V>;
// No runtime checking, use to improve performance in some case. 
// For examplem, when executed in an execution environment,which is impossible to trigger bounds checking.
unsafe fn get_unchecked(&self, index: K) -> &V;
unsafe fn get_unchecked_mut(&mut self, index: K) -> &mut V;
```
